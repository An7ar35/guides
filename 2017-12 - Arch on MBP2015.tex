\section{Forewords}

\noindent After lots of reading, searching, experimenting, furious late-night shell command typing and 
do-overs here are the results of replacing OSX with Arch Linux (KDE) on a mid-2015 MacBook Pro. 

\noindent This guide is a record of my experience and results. I'm leaving this out there for anyone that
might find this useful.

\noindent I would also advise backing up your drive using a complete bit-to-bit cloning process (unlike me...oops) so that you retain a copy of everything including the recovery partition on the Mac. 
It's better to be safe...

\section{Machine Specs}

\begin{tabular}{c|l}
	\hline
	Display   & 15.4" LED-backlit Retina display with IPS technology; 2880-by-1800 native resolution at 220 pixels per inch with support for millions of colours \\\hline
	Processor & 2.5GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.7GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache \\\hline
	RAM       & 16GB of 1600MHz DDR3L memory \\\hline
	GPU       & Intel Iris Pro Graphics, <br>AMD Radeon R9 M370X with 2GB of GDDR5 memory \\\hline
	Storage   & 512GB PCIe-based flash \\\hline
	Webcam    & 720p FaceTime HD camera \\\hline
	Network   & 802.11ac Wiâ€‘Fi wireless networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible, <br>Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology \\\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Results}

//TODO

//Heating issues with mbp, fan control and turning off boost on the processor to keep things
reasonable temperature-wise.

\section{Pre-Installation}

\subsection{Preparations}

\begin{itemize-steps}
	\item \textbf{Backup drive} (complete drive clone preferable).
	\item Make a copy of the colour profile file(s) on the mac located in \code{/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays/*} to a USB stick. It will be useful later on Linux.

\end{itemize-steps}

\subsection{Making a bootable USB}

\subsubsection{From Linux}

\begin{itemize-steps}
	\item \terminalcmd{dd if=archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=16M \&\& sync} \\
	      \block{Where \code{X} is your target USB drive letter (use \code{lsblk} for an overview of all connected drives to find out)}
\end{itemize-steps}

\subsubsection{From a Mac}

\begin{itemize-steps}
	\item \terminalcmd{diskutil unmountDisk diskX} \\
		  \block{Where \code{X} is your target USB drive number (use \code{diskutil list} for an overview of all connected drives to find out).}
	\item \terminalcmd{sudo dd if=/Users/\$USERNAME/Downloads/archlinux.iso of=/dev/diskX bs=16M}\\
		  \block{Replace \code{\$USERNAME} with your username on the mac and replace \code{X} with the USB drive's number.}
\end{itemize-steps}


\section{Installation}

\subsection{Booting from the USB stick}

Simply plug in the USB in the MBP and press the \fbox{Alt} (a.k.a. \fbox{options}) key during start up
to reach the boot menu.

\subsection{Preliminary setup}

\begin{itemize-steps}
	\item \terminalcmd{loadkeys uk}\\
		  \block{Load your keyboard layout. Replace `uk` with whichever you have on your machine.}
	\item \terminalcmd{wifi-menu}\\
		  \block{Connect up to the wifi network. On the MPB Pro 2015 the wifi gets detected and works out of the box at this stage.}
\end{itemize-steps}
